				<header>ONE:GLOBAL STORY</header>
				  <p>
						Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, and pattern recognition. Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, may connote robotics or futuristic scenes, AI goes well beyond the automatons of science fiction, into the non-fiction of modern day advanced computer science. A prominent researcher in this field, describes five tribes of machine learning, comprised of symbolists, with origins in logic and philosophy, connectionists, stemming from neuroscience, evolutionaries, relating to evolutionary biology, Bayesians, engaged with statistics and probability, and analogizers with origins in psychology.

				<header>TWO:SOLVING THE PROBLEM</header>
				  <p>
						The problem is solved using the AWS services Amazon Rekognition Image and Amazon Rekognition Video can return the bounding box for common object labels such as cars, furniture, apparel or pets. Bounding box information isn't returned for less common object labels. You can use bounding boxes to find the exact locations of objects in an image, count instances of detected objects, or to measure an object's size using bounding box dimensions.

				<header>THREE:HOW TO USE</header>
				  <p>
						In order to use AI on AWS you need to have an account on the Amazon Web Services platform. Using a VPN you can connect your network to your own Virtual Private Cloud. Once installed and connected to your network, AWS Panorama devices connect to the AWS Management Console where you can register your AWS Panorama device and add video feeds from onsite cameras, deploy trained ML models, and run applications in minutes.

				<header>FOUR:WHO IS USING</header>
				  <p>
						A lot of companies are using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) today. Just like the  Vancouver Fraser Port Authority (Port of Vancouver) which identified a need to enhance coordination, transparency, and supply chain efficiency of the container examination process for the Western Canadian Gateway. It was a major source of complaints and challenges among the entire port community. Reliable information on actual operations was limited. They decided to migrate to the AWS platform and use AWS services instead.

				<header>FIVE:WHAT TO EXPECT</header>
				  <p>
						Analyze millions of images, streaming, and stored videos within seconds, and augment human review tasks with artificial intelligence (AI).
						Scale up and down based on your business needs with fully managed AI capabilities and pay only for the images and videos you analyze.
						Pay as you go, only for the services which are being used. Turn off any virtual machines and services when not used.

				<header>SIX:WHATS NEXT</header>
				  <p>
						AWS pre-trained AI Services provide ready-made intelligence for your applications and workflows. AI Services easily integrate with your applications to address common use cases such as personalized recommendations, modernizing your contact center, improving safety and security, and increasing customer engagement. Because we use the same deep learning technology that powers Amazon.com and our ML Services, you get quality and accuracy from continuously-learning APIs. And best of all, AI Services on AWS don't require machine learning experience.
